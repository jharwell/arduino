* General notes
- How much of the code should be given to them? Maybe give them a choice between building off of the previous experiment
  to try to make the LED controlled by a push button, and just giving them the code?

* Extensions
- Can you change the PIN in the code and figure out how to still get the LED to blink?
- Can you make 2 LEDs blink at the same time from a single pin?
- Can you make 2 LEDs blink at the same time from two different pins?
- Can you make 2 LEDs blink alternatively?
