* General notes
- Some pushbuttons are a little sticky; if you don't firmly press down on them, they can get stuck on and make you think
  your circuit or your code is wrong.
- This exp is basically 2 circuits. Build each in turn, starting with the LED circuit from exp1.

* Extensions
- Can you make the LED turn on when the button is not pressed?
- Can you make it take 2 button presses to turn on the LED?
- Can you make 1 LED turn on when the button is being pressed, and another when it is not pressed?
